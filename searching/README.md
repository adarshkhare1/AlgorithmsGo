## Searching
- [Find Maximum Subarray](/searching/findMaxSubarray.go)
  Search a Subarray from a given integers array such that the sum of elements 
  in returned subarray is maximum. Minimum SumArray size will be 2 elements to
  maximum full array length.  If single element array is given as input, sum 
  will be the element value.
- [Sorted List - Sequential search with skip](/searching/sortedArraySearch.go)
  Return the index of the matching element in a sorted array, -1 if element not found. Method uses
random jumps on sorted list.
- [Sorted List - Binary search](/searching/sortedArraySearch.go)
Return the index of the matching element in a sorted array, -1 if element not found. Method uses
binary search with recursion.
- [Find longest common subsequence](/searching/commonSubsequence.go)
  In two given DNA sequences, find how similar they are.
