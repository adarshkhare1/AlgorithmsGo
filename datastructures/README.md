## Data Structures
  - [B-Tree](B Tree/bTree.go)
B-trees are balanced search trees designed to work well on disks or other direct access
secondary storage. Implementation here will be using file system I/O with one file for
every node, in other applications this can be any other method of disk i/o operation.
  - [Binary Tree](binaryTree/binaryTree.go)
  - [Doubly Linked List](linkedList/doubleLinkedList.go)
  - [Priority Queue](priorityQueue.go)  
Priority Queue implementation using MaxHeap structure, elements with maximum value will have the highest priority.
  - [Queue](queue.go)
Queue ensures the first-in-last-out for any element in the set.
  - [Red Black Tree](redBlackTree/redBlackTree.go)
A binary tree that satisfies red-black properties. Red-black properties ensure that tree is approximately balanced.
All basic dynamic-set operations take O(lg n) time in worst case.
  - [Singly Linked List](linkedList/linkedList.go)
  - [Stack](stack.go)
Stack ensure the last-in-first-out for any element in the set.
