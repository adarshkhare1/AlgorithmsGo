## Data Structures
  - [Binary Tree](binaryTree/binaryTree.go)
  - [Doubly Linked List](linkedList/doubleLinkedList.go)
  - [Priority Queue](priorityQueue.go)  
Priority Queue implementation using MaxHeap structure, elements with maximum value will have the highest priority.
  - [Queue](queue.go)
Queue ensures the first-in-last-out for any element in the set.
  - [Red Black Tree](redBlackTreeTree/redBlackTree.go)
A binary tree that satisfies red-black properties. Red-black properties ensure that tree is approximately balanced.
All basic dynamic-set operations take O(lg n) time in worst case.
  - [Singly Linked List](linkedList/linkedList.go)
  - [Stack](stack.go)
Stack ensure the last-in-first-out for any element in the set.
